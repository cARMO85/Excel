# Excel Dashboard

Welcome to the Coca Cola Dashboard repository! This dashboard is designed to monitor and track key performance indicators (KPIs) for sales related to regions, brands, and retailers.

With this dashboard, you will be able to:

View sales data by region, brand, and retailer
Compare sales performance over time
Identify trends and patterns in sales data
This dashboard was built using Excel and advanced Excel functions such as pivot tables and charts. It is a powerful tool that allows you to easily track and analyze sales data in order to make informed decisions about your business.

To get started with the Coca Cola Dashboard, simply clone this repository and open the Excel file. The dashboard is fully interactive, so you can explore the data and customize your views as needed.

If you have any questions or feedback about the dashboard, please don't hesitate to reach out. I'm always looking for ways to improve and optimize the tool for my users.

Thank you.
Paul
